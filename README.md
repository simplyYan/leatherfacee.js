## Note
The leatherfacee.js framework is like a real chainsaw, spinning endlessly, passing through many large corporations and everyone who uses this framework. But it's important to remember, and with great pride, that the starting point, the first primordial activation of this chainsaw, was in Brazil, where this project was born. The name of the framework represents the name of a very cool character, who I like a lot, so I was out of ideas, and I had the brilliant and weird idea of using his name and adding another letter “e”, to give it a difference.
